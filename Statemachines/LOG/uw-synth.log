Info: Constraints: Precision will generate the constraint: create_clock [get_ports clk] -name clk -period 20 -waveform {0 10} on port:clk. Reason: setup_design -frequency. Please override the constraint if needed.
Info: Constraints: Precision will generate the following clock domain information against the clocks. Since the clock domain information is not provided by the user for the below clocks, all clocks are assumed to be synchronous clocks. This will result in all paths between the clock domains to be analyzed for timing. If this behaviour is not intended for any clock domain or path, please override using -domain option or false path constraint. Among these clocks, clock with the smallest period will be chosen as the default domain and the rest of the clock periods specified using multiply-by or divide-by factor.
